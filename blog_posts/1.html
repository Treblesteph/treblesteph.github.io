    Like pretty much every academic I know, I am prone to imposter syndrome a lot of the time. I am highly capable, well trained, and produce brilliant things. However, more often than not, I feel like a fraud, and I spend a great deal of what should be productive thinking time, picking apart my achievements and convincing myself that they, and I, are worthless.

    Taking time out of my PhD to have a baby has really enabled me to reflect on my approach to life and work. I have decided that I need to realign my thinking, and hone some of my more subtly neglected skills.
  </p>

  <h5 class="para-heading">gravitas</h5>
  <p class="flow-text">
    So I have decided to take some more time out to do this, and I'm going to document the process here. To begin my journey of self-improvement, I started reading <a class="link" href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rd1lAQAAQBAJ&dq=gravitas&source=gbs_navlinks_s" target="_blank">this book</a> which turned my thinking upside down. The reasons that I am shy/lack confidence/don't like to be outside my comfort zone/often lack drive in my career compared to my private life, probably stem from difficult things that happened in my past. Therefore I always assumed that the only way to overcome such barriers was to go back and deal with all of my psychological baggage. This seemed like a huge, insurmountable task, that would probably take the rest of my life, leaving my career prospects behind. What I hadn't fully grasped was the full extent of the 'fake it 'til you make it' approach. Although it isn't really faking it, it's just learning some self-presentation skills, and positive thinking patterns.
  </p>

  <p class="flow-text">
    The book focuses on <b>knowledge</b>, <b>purpose</b>, and <b>passion</b>: the three major components you will need in order to "communicate with confidence, influence, and authority" - to have 'Gravitas'. There are several chapters describing what it means to have Gravitas, but I distilled it down to mean being true to yourself and others, owning your achievements and shortcomings, and having your feet firmly on the ground. These qualities generally result in a likeable, easy-going character. I will return to these three components throughout my writing, and try to explain why I feel like they really are the perfect recipe for being someone who can do fullfilling and meaningful work.

    One of my favourite tips on how to project a confident self image from the book was the dragon tail. You have to imagine that you have a large, heavy, and magnificent tail. It affects how you sit, stand, and walk, both in its size, and in how it makes you feel (grand). I imagine mine to be a similar shape to the picture below, although perhaps a bit taller so it reaches above my head. I know it seems kind of silly, and most of the time I don't feel that I need to imagine having a tail, but there are some times, like before an interview, difficult conversation, or meeting someone intimidating, where it really makes a difference to me.

  <h5 class="para-heading">knowledge</h5>
  <p class="flow-text">
    In order to accomplish the 'knowledge' aspect of gravitas, I have a skills development plan for the coming months. I will address this in more detail in <a class="link" href="#" onclick="loadblogpost('2')">my next post</a>. I am have devised a work plan that will build my skills and confidence in areas where I feel weak.
  </p>

  <p class="flow-text">
    I feel like I used to own my knowledge. I used to be proud of my mathematics skills, and really enjoyed talking about maths confidently. I think that <a class="link" href="index.html">too much time in formal education</a> may have caused me to lose some of that confidence. I am too used to preparing for exams, too used to theory and logical thinking (definitely useful skills), but not confident in putting my knowledge into practice. I don't feel like I have much to offer, because education for education's sake is not actually very useful, so I don't actually have much to offer. <a class="link" href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/6-harsh-truths-that-will-make-you-better-person/" target="_blank">This Cracked article</a> by David Wong puts it in a better (but perhaps slightly more agressive than is necessary) way: the world only cares about what it can get from you, it doesn't care that you are a 'nice guy', and what you are inside only matters because of what it makes you do.
  </p>

  <p class="flow-text">
    I am focussing on programming skills since that is what I really enjoy doing (I spend most of my PhD time coding mathematical models of biological systems), so that is how I think I will be most useful to the world. I am going to do a series of small projects with the following rules:
    <ul style="padding-left: 30px">
      <li class="flow-text">2 weeks turnaround time</li>
      <li class="flow-text">1 blog post at the start with the plan</li>
      <li class="flow-text">1 blog post at the end with documentation</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p class="flow-text">
    I primarily want to learn about web design and app development, with a strong focus on following good coding practises and producing good quality, and well-documented code. I have been programming mathematical models since my Master's in 2011, but have only started on non-academic programming very recently. So I hope the initial projects will help me to get to grips with the basics of html, JavaScript, and CSS, before I move onto other platforms like Meteor. The initial list of sprints will be outlined in my <a class="link" href="2_knowledge.html">next post</a>, however I may change this up as I learn new things and have more ideas.
  </p>

  <h5 class="para-heading">my primary goals</h5>
  <p class="flow-text">
    I hold my work to high standards, and regardless of how slow it makes me, the most important thing to me is having well written and documented code. However sometimes this way of thinking prevents me from getting anything down at all: it is difficult to learn a new language at the same time as learning to style everything correctly, especially when trying to get a difficult concept to work. So I really welcome constructive criticism if anyone wants to take the time to read through any of my code! This also feeds into my other aim which is to overcome my fear of partaking in online commmunities/discussions. Over the next few months I'll endeavour to put myself out there more, and engage in online activity. Asking questions on StackOverflow, discussing and debating on Twitter, joining Gitter rooms for projects I am interested in. The thought of all these things makes me immensely uncomfortable, but perhaps I'll feel better about it with some practise.
